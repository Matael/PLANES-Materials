% PLANES (Porous LAum NumErical Simulator) is a software to compute the
% vibroacoustic response of sound packages containing coupled
% acoustic/elastic/porous substructures. It is mainly based on the
% Finite-Element Method and some numerical methods developped at
% LAUM (http://laum.univ-lemans.fr).
